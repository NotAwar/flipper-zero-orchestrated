# Flipper Zero Containerization System

The containerization system for Flipper Zero provides a minimal-overhead way to run and manage applications
in a resource-efficient manner. This system draws inspiration from container orchestration systems like 
Kubernetes but is specifically designed for the highly constrained microcontroller environment.

## Architecture

The system consists of the following key components:

- **Container Runtime**: Manages container lifecycle (create, start, stop, destroy)
- **Pod Manifest**: Defines container groups and their configurations
- **Service Registry**: Provides lightweight service discovery for inter-container communication
- **Resource Manager**: Enforces memory and CPU limits for containers

## Performance Optimizations

The containerization system implements several critical optimizations for resource-constrained environments:

- **Memory Pooling**: Containers reuse memory from a pre-allocated pool instead of frequent malloc/free
- **Hash-Based Service Lookups**: O(1) service discovery with hash-based optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Resources are loaded only when needed to minimize memory footprint
- **Zero-Copy IPC**: Communication between containers uses shared memory references when possible
- **Static Pre-allocation**: Critical resources are pre-allocated to avoid heap fragmentation
- **Scheduled Health Checks**: Health checks are performed at timed intervals, not continuously

## Resource Constraints

Flipper Zero has extremely limited resources compared to typical container environments:

| Resource | Limit | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| RAM | ~256KB | Shared between system and all containers |
| CPU | 64MHz | ARM Cortex-M4 |
| Storage | ~2MB | Available for all container images |
| Power | Battery | Energy efficiency is critical |

Containers must be designed with these constraints in mind. Typical containers use 2-10KB of RAM.

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Simple Container

```c
// Create a pod manifest
PodManifest* manifest = pod_manifest_create();
manifest->name = "my-app";
manifest->container_count = 1;
manifest->containers[0].name = "main";
manifest->containers[0].entry_point = my_app_main;

// Start the container
ContainerRuntime* runtime = container_runtime_get_instance();
container_runtime_start(runtime, manifest);
```

### Service Registration and Discovery

```c
// Register a service
ServiceRegistry* registry = service_registry_get_instance();
MyService* my_service = my_service_create();
service_registry_register(registry, "my-service", my_service);

// Discover a service
MyService* service = service_registry_get_service(registry, "my-service");
if(service) {
    my_service_call_method(service);
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Resource Planning**: Always specify reasonable resource limits in pod manifests
2. **Container Count**: Keep container count very low - optimal performance with 2-3 containers
3. **Service Discovery**: Use service registry for interface discovery rather than direct references
4. **Static Allocation**: Prefer static allocation over dynamic whenever possible
5. **Lazy Initialization**: Initialize resources only when needed, not at startup
6. **Garbage Collection**: Implement proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
7. **Health Checks**: Use periodic health checks with reasonable intervals (5-10s)
8. **Namespaces**: Organize services into namespaces for better isolation
9. **Minimal Containers**: Keep container images as small as possible

## Future Improvements

- Resource quotas at namespace level
- Container networking with virtual interfaces
- Volume mounts for shared persistent storage
- Improved health checks and self-healing mechanisms
- Configuration maps for environment variables
