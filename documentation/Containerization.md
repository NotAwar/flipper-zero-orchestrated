# Flipper Zero Containerization System

The containerization system for Flipper Zero provides a minimal-overhead way to run and manage applications
in a resource-efficient manner. This system draws inspiration from container orchestration systems like
Kubernetes but is specifically designed for the highly constrained microcontroller environment.

## Architecture

The system consists of the following key components:

- **Container Runtime**: Manages container lifecycle (create, start, stop, destroy)
- **Pod Manifest**: Defines container groups and their configurations
- **Service Registry**: Provides lightweight service discovery for inter-container communication
- **Resource Manager**: Enforces memory and CPU limits for containers

## Performance Optimizations

The containerization system implements several critical optimizations for resource-constrained environments:

- **Memory Pooling**: Containers reuse memory from a pre-allocated pool instead of frequent malloc/free
- **Hash-Based Service Lookups**: O(1) service discovery with hash-based optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Resources are loaded only when needed to minimize memory footprint
- **Zero-Copy IPC**: Communication between containers uses shared memory references when possible

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Simple Container

```c
// Create a pod manifest
PodManifest* manifest = pod_manifest_create();
manifest->name = "my-app";
manifest->container_count = 1;
manifest->containers[0].name = "main";
manifest->containers[0].entry_point = my_app_main;

// Start the container
ContainerRuntime* runtime = container_runtime_get_instance();
container_runtime_start(runtime, manifest);
```

### Service Registration and Discovery

```c
// Register a service
ServiceRegistry* registry = service_registry_get_instance();
MyService* my_service = my_service_create();
service_registry_register(registry, "my-service", my_service);

// Discover a service
MyService* service = service_registry_get_service(registry, "my-service");
if(service) {
    my_service_call_method(service);
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Always specify resource limits in pod manifests
2. Keep container count low - optimal performance with 3-5 containers
3. Use service registry for interface discovery rather than direct references
4. Implement graceful shutdown in containers to prevent resource leaks
5. Prefer static allocation over dynamic when possible

## Future Improvements

- Container networking with virtual interfaces
- Volume mounts for shared persistent storage
- Container health checks and self-healing
- Configuration maps for environment variables
