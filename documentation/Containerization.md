# Lightweight Application Containers for Flipper Zero

## Overview

The containerization system for Flipper Zero provides a minimal-overhead way to run and manage applications in a resource-efficient manner. This system draws inspiration from container orchestration systems like Kubernetes but is specifically designed for the highly constrained microcontroller environment.

## Technical Specifications

This system is designed with the Flipper Zero's limited resources in mind:
- STM32WB55 MCU with ARM Cortex-M4 core (64 MHz)
- 1MB Flash memory
- 256KB RAM

## Core Components

### Container Runtime

The container runtime manages application lifecycles:
- Starting/stopping applications
- Basic resource monitoring
- Auto-restart capabilities

### Service Registry

A lightweight service discovery mechanism:
- Registration of internal and external services
- Service lookup by name and namespace
- Connection facilitation

### Pod Manifests

Declarative application definitions:
- Compact manifest format (not JSON, more efficient)
- Multi-container pod support
- Resource specifications
- Health check definitions (optional)

## CLI Commands

Access container functionality through the command line:
